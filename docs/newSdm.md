## Create a new Software Delivery Machine (SDM) repository

Choose `blank` for a new SDM to which you can add your own functionality.

Choose `spring` for a new SDM providing convenient creation and local CD
of Spring Boot applications.

Choose `sample` for a sample containing Java and Node functionality.
This is a good example of the Atomist API,
but isn't intended as a basis for your own SDM.

> If you're new to Atomist and have a JDK on your machine,
choose "spring" to see Atomist's capabilities quickly.
